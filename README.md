# About
Welcome to The Nongame!, a conversation game! Players "compete" to complete laps around the board by answering prompts. The Nongame! is great for:
- Therapy groups
- School classes
- Retirement home activities
- Family game night
- Youth groups
- Any gathering where people want to get to know each other better!

Set up your game by choosing:
- Prompt categories (e.g. All Ages, Families, Kids, Seniors, Teens, etc.)
- Which prompt types will display:
	- Random prompt from the previously-selected prompt category
	- Ask someone a question OR comment on any subject
	- Talk about a time when you felt a certain emotion
- Number of players
- Player names

Then click Play! The first player will begin the game by clicking the dice. That player's emoji pawn moves to the appropriate space, and a prompt appears in the center of the board. As players make their way around the board, each player's lap counter will increase. A player's card will take on a gold background if they take the lead! 45 minutes to 1 hour makes for a great game length. At the end of the game, a Results page will display with the game's results!

Click Custom Deck to create custom prompt "decks." Users may create an infinite number of decks with an infinite number of prompts! The Nongame! stores all decks and prompts in a secured database, so users may rest easy knowing that their data will persist across devices and between browser sessions.
