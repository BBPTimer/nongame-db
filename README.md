## Play The Nongame! at [Nongame.App](https://www.nongame.app)!

Welcome to The Nongame!, a conversation game! Players "compete" to complete laps around the board by answering prompts. The Nongame! is great for:

- Therapy groups
- School classes
- Retirement home activities
- Family game night
- Youth groups
- Any gathering where people want to get to know each other better!

The game begins with the Setup form. First, choose which prompts you would like to appear in the game. Select a prompt deck category and depth (Lighthearted or Deep). Lighthearted prompts make great icebreakers, while deep prompts promote serious discussion. Click the info icon to preview prompts from the selected deck.

Next, select your desired prompt types. Prompts fall into 3 categories:

1. _Playing cards_: A random prompt is displayed from the previously-selected prompt deck.

2. _Question exchange_: Ask someone a question OR comment on any subject. This gives players an opportunity to engage with each other and discuss whatever's on the mind!

3. _Comedy mask_: Players will talk about a time when they felt a certain emotion.

Select your number of players, and type in their names! The game supports 2-6 players. If you have more than 6 players, we recommend choosing 1 player and competing as a group to complete laps around the board. Click the Play! button to begin the game.

Player order is selected randomly. The first player will begin the game by clicking the dice. That player's emoji pawn moves to the appropriate space, and a prompt appears in the center of the board.

Other players should remain quiet when a player responds to a prompt! After a player responds, the next player rolls the dice, and play continues.

As players make their way around the board, each player's lap counter will increase. A player's card will take on a gold background if they take the lead! 45 minutes to 1 hour makes for a great game length. See which player completes the most laps by the end of the game, and have fun!
